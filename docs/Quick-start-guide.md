So you've invited Lunar to your Discord and are now curious on how to set it all up - you've come to the right place! This quick start guide will take you through the first few steps in a matter of minutes. So let's get started, shall we?

### **How to set up Lunar - the easy way**
**0** - If you haven't done so already, [invite](https://maikdevries.com/lunar) the bot to your Discord.

**1** - Double check that the bot has the right permissions and is above all other non-administrative roles:

<i>This is essential for features like Reaction Role and Stream Status such that they work properly!</i></p>

**2** - To perform a first-time setup, make use of the `!setup [feature]` command where `[feature]` is the feature you want to set up. Example: `!setup twitch`. This will take you through the necessary steps to get a feature up and running.

**3** - That's it! There isn't much left to do after you've gone through the setup for each feature you want to use. If you're a tweaker, then refer to the [in-depth guide](./In-depth-guide.md) for more knobs to turn.
